## Scope:
Tool condition experimental data are collected under 2 different manufacturing cutters. 

1. use a single cutter (experiment1.csv) to build up regresison model
- separate data into train and test (80-20)
- test and evaluate model accuracy
- **correlation analysis** to select features, use the selected features and rebuild regression modelling
- **principle component analysis (PCA)** for data compression and model testing
- compare all the modelling results

2. use one cutter (experiment1.csv) as training and another cutter (experiement1_1.csv) as testing to build up model.
- test and evaluate model accuracy
- **correlation analysis** to select features, use the selected features and rebuild regression modelling
- **principle component analysis (PCA)** for data compression and model testing
- compare all the modelling results
